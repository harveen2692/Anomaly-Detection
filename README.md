# Anomaly Detection System

This covers the exercise from Andrew Ng's machine learning class on Coursera in Python.

This notebook is divided into two parts. First, the anomaly detection algorithm is implemented on a smaller 2D dataset. This will allow us to visualize the outliers clearly. After developing the required functions, it is implemented on the higher dimensional dataset.
